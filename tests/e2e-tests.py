# basic setup:
# - start server in some thread
# - create sender thread that sends some file
# - create receiver that receives it


# test cases:
# 1) invalid sender args
# 2) invalid receiver args
# 3) transfer declined by receiver
# 4) invalid receiver link
# 5) accepted transfer of some small file (hello world)
# 6) accepted transfer of docs directory with preview.mp4
# 7) accepted transfer of some dummy structure (just like in utils tests)
